The Annual Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading honors poet, Morton Marcus (1936-2009). Marcus, a nationally acclaimed poet, called Santa Cruz his home for more than 50 years. This annual poetry series continues Mort's tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, acknowledges the significant role poetry has played in our community's history, and works to maintain poetry's influence in our county's culture. The Morton Marcus Poetry Archive is housed in Special Collection, McHenry Library, UC Santa Cruz. [www.mortonmarcus.com](http://www.mortonmarcus.com).
