The Quarry, which has been closed to events since 2006, had served as a center of campus life since UC Santa Cruz was founded 50 years ago. The Student Fee Advisory Committee, which endorsed use of fees toward the project, is the primary avenue for advising the chancellor and executive vice chancellor on allocation of fees.

The committee is composed of students and other campus representatives.

"This is an exciting advancement of this project," said Alison Galloway, executive vice chancellor and provost. "We are grateful for this powerful endorsement by students. We hope it inspires our alumni and others to join in bringing back this quintessential gathering space in the heart of campus."

During [Alumni Weekend](http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/), April 23-26, tours of the Quarry will be offered, and visitors will have the opportunity to share their Quarry stories. An estimated $1.2 million in additional funding is needed to move forward with the initial phase of the project, which will reopen the Quarry.

If fundraising is successful, work is projected to begin in 2016. Reopening the Quarry Amphitheater is a priority of [The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz](http://campaign.ucsc.edu).
