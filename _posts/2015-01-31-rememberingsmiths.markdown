<div class="event-type-host">Symposium | Hosted by: Cowell, UE</div>
We will have speakers come to a one-day celebration in memory of Page and Eloise Smith. Page Smith was the founding provost of Cowell and, in fact, of UCSC. He was also a noted historian. The symposium will be a mix of personal recollections and professional observations. John Dizikes will serve as honorary chair of the symposium.
