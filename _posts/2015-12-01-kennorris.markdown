####Reception | Hosted by: Environmental Studies
In March 2014, UCSC received a generous gift from the Packard Foundation to support the establishment of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History which will foster natural history research and training at UC Santa Cruz. 

In late winter/early spring 2015 we will have a naming ceremony for the center - exact date TBA. This will be an opportunity to celebrate natural history training accomplishments over the past 50 years and articulate a vision for the new Norris Center to the campus community, alumni, and other potential donors.

Date: Winter 2015
