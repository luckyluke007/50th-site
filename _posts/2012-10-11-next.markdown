Breakthroughs aren’t achieved by adhering to the status quo. And for 50 years, UC Santa Cruz has been blazing a trail of bold, progressive, fearless inquiry that benefits both the individual and the planet.
There is much more to do.  [The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz](http://campaign.ucsc.edu) is a campus-wide fundraising effort to build resources for the future.  It highlights initiatives in areas of extraordinary impact--genomics, coastal sustainability, data science, the arts and sciences—and in the transformative experience we offer students.  Among special projects: Bringing back the Quarry Amphitheater, a campus landmark.

We invite your investment in our students, faculty, and programs as they create the next 50.
