Breakthroughs aren’t achieved by adhering to the status quo. And for 50 years, UC Santa Cruz has been blazing a trail of bold, progressive, fearless inquiry. We aren’t stopping now.

The [Campaign for UC Santa Cruz](http://campaign.ucsc.edu) is a campus-wide fundraising effort to carry on our legacy by building resources for the future. It supports our students, faculty, programs, and facilities.

The campaign highlights areas of extraordinary impact, including

- [UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute](http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/initiatives/genomics/)
- [Coastal Sustainability](http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/initiatives/coastal/)
- [Data Science Leadership](http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/initiatives/data-science/)
- [Institute of the Arts and Sciences](http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/initiatives/institute/)

Special projects include reopening the [Quarry Amphitheater](http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/student-experience/the-quarry-amphitheater/), a campus landmark. 

We invite your investment in our students, faculty, and programs as we create the next 50 years.
