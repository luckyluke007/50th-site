Breakthroughs aren’t achieved by adhering to the status quo. And for 50 years, UC Santa Cruz has been blazing a trail of bold, progressive, fearless inquiry that benefits both the individual and the planet.

Today, we continue to push the boundaries of conventional academic study. We
work across disciplines and pursue original research into the most pressing scientific, social, and political issues of the day.

That’s because at UC Santa Cruz, it’s not just about reciting the right answers. It’s about asking the right questions. See how the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz is helping to ensure we keep on asking.
