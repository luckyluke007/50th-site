The Faculty Research Lecture is an annual event honoring the outstanding research of UCSC faculty and is one of the longest standing traditions in the UC system, dating back to 1913 at UC Berkeley, and 1967 at UC Santa Cruz. 

This event gives the wider community a vision of the outstanding research being done at UCSC. For the 50th Anniversary, one awardee from each of the 5 divisions will be invited to participate at the lecture. The divisions also invite former graduate students back for the presentation, thus highlighting the footprint of the Faculty Research Lectures and UCSC's impact.

Date: TBA
