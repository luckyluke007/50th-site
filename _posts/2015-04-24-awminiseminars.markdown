####Seminar Series | Hosted by: Literature
From its inception as one of the original Boards of Study, the Literature Department at UC Santa Cruz has had a distinctive identity on campus as well as within the world of scholarship. To celebrate our tradition of working and teaching across national, linguistic, and disciplinary divides, a series of short seminars will pair emeritus faculty with current faculty and alumni for lively, engaging conversations during Alumni Weekend.
