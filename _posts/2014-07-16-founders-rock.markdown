*"In these lovely surroundings will be built the University of California, Santa Cruz, a new kind of university campus powered by new ideas that are already attracting the attention of the academic world."*
—UC President Clark Kerr, April 17, 1964

Exactly a half-century ago today, a defining moment in UCSC history took place.

On April 17, 1964, nearly 2,000 people gathered to witness the dedication of UC Santa Cruz— the UC system's newest campus. UC President Clark Kerr was on hand, along with founding UCSC chancellor Dean McHenry, then-Gov. Edmund G. "Pat" Brown, state senators, city and county officials, and many UC Regents. 

As UC Santa Cruz approaches its 50th anniversary in 2015, we're celebrating our past while looking forward to a bright and shining future. 

We've built a living timeline at 50years.ucsc.edu, and it's taking off. Join us in telling the story of UCSC by sharing your photos and memories. Tell us how this place changed you, what it means to the community, to California, to the nation, to the world.

Then get ready to help us celebrate... 
Fiat Slug!
