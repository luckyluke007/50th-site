<div class="event-type-host">Reunion and Breakfast | Hosted by: Staff Advisory Board</div>
The Staff Advisory Board hosts a Staff Appreciation Picnic or Breakfast every year. For the 50th Anniversary we would like to invite retired and past staff as well as current staff to the event. We hope to partner with the Retiree&#39;s Association, SHR and the Staff Diversity Group to create the invitation list and expand the event. We hope to have staff from every decade who can tell their stories about working at UCSC.
