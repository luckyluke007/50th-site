<div class="event-type-host">Showcase of documentary work by graduating Master's students | Hosted by: Film and Digital Media</div>
Annual June showing of documentary work by graduating Master&#39;s students. 

2015 will be the ten year anniversary of the start of the Social Documentation Program, so it addition to graduating student work from that year, we are also considering offering a retrospective of Social Documentation work throughout the ages, or at least a curated selection of SocDoc works. This showing of documentary work represents another strong way to connect the community with the history of field and the history of the campus.

Date: June 2015
