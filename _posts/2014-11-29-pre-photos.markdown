1961: With a new UC campus approved for Santa Cruz, city residents didn't wait until the campus opened in 1965 to put out the welcome mat. In this December 1961 photo, longtime residents Gilda, Estrella, and Malio Stagnaro displayed their excitement in a Christmas lawn decoration in front of their their Bay Street home.

The banners read (l-r): "A Step To Higher Education," "UC Campus Santa Cruz," "Hello There," "1961 Seasons Greetings," "Spirit of University of California," and "Up The Ladder To Success."
