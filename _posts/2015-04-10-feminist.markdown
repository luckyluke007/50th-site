####Conference | Hosted by: Education
Gloria Evangelina Anzaldúa -- poet, philosopher, and critical scholar -- founded, wrote, and encouraged a transformative body of writing and scholarship, with generative influences on critical race, feminist, queer, and decolonizing ways of knowing. Importantly for UCSC, Anzaldua was a vital presence on our campus for over twenty years, and her legacy is a profound part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the campus.

The UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies is proud to initiate a celebration of the intellectual legacy of Gloria Anzaldúa. This year-long celebration includes a series of undergraduate workshops and creative writing seminars, advanced study seminars for graduate students and faculty, performances by artists and poets as part of the creative writing Living Writers' reading series, and an installation of Anzaldúa's writing altar from her archives in McHenry Library's Special Collections. Finally, our celebration will culminate in a two-day (April 10-11, 2015) scholarly conference: The Feminist Architecture of Gloria E. Anzaldúa: New Translations, Crossings, and Pedagogies in Anzaldúan Thought.
