####Dedication | Hosted by: Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems
Part hoe-down, part cocktail party, this event will celebrate the restoration of the historic Hay Barn and its reuse as the new headquarters for the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) and other South Campus sustainability programs, and the new "gateway" to the UCSC Farm. Join us to help celebrate this campus history milestone, featuring food, drink and live music.
