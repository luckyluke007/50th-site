<div class="event-type-host">Concert | Hosted by: Cowell, UE</div>
The Dizikes Concert is an annual event, and it is always well attended. In light of UCSC turning 50, the songs this year will be popular songs on the hit parade in 1965-1966. Some of the songs will have surprising and revised lyrics.

Date: April 26, 2015
