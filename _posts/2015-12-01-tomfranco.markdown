####Art Exhibit | Hosted by: Sesnon Gallery
Tom Franco challenges the stereotype that artists must seek their muse by working alone in their studio. Instead, Franco has invested in a collection of buildings and spaces that promotes collaboration and community. 

The collective, spread throughout the East Bay, has live-work housing, studios, cafes, galleries, and event and performance spaces. This open platform and participatory style is being adopted and practiced by galleries and museums around the world.

Date: TBA
