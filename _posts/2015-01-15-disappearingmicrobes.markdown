####Public Lecture | Hosted by: Microbiology and Environmental Toxiology
The METX Department&#39;s 15th anniversary coincides with UCSC&#39;s 50th anniversary and in honor of both celebrations this public lecture by renowned Professor Martin Blaser will engage the local community and increase awareness of the exciting work happening on campus.

In Missing Microbes, Dr. Martin Blaser reaches back to the discovery of antibiotics, which ushered in a golden age of medicine, and then traces how our subsequent overuse of these seeming wonder drugs has left its mark on our systems, contributing to the rise of what Blaser calls our modern plagues: obesity, asthma, allergies, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer. Blaser's studies suggest antibiotic use during early childhood poses the greatest risk to long-term health, and, alarmingly, American children receive on average about seventeen courses of antibiotics before they are twenty years old. At the same time, C-sections deprive babies of important contact with their mothers' microbiomes. Taking us into the lab to recount studies, Blaser provides support for his theory and guides us to what we can do to avoid even more catastrophic health problems in the future.
