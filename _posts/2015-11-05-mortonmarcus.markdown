The Annual Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading honors poet, Morton Marcus (1936-2009), and highlights his poetry archive housed in UCSC's Special Collections and Archives. Marcus, a nationally acclaimed poet, called Santa Cruz his home for more than 50 years. This annual poetry series continues Mort's tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, continues to acknowledge the significant role poetry has played in our community's history, and works to maintain poetry's influence in our county's culture [www.mortonmarcus.com](http://www.mortonmarcus.com).

In November, 2015, former California Poet Laureate, and UCSC faculty member, Al Young will be our featured poet, which we believe will tie in well with UCSC's 50th celebrations. [Learn more about Al Young](http://alyoung.org/)
