Ecotopia is not one of the great classics of American literature, but that hardly matters: the novel has sold nearly one million copies since 1975, and its impact on the global environmental movement has been inestimable. And its significance for UCSC should not be underestimated, either.

Today, more than ever, the material, philosophical and spiritual insights given expression by Ernest Callenbach remind us that the tasks taken up by the emerging ecology movement 50 years ago are not yet accomplished. With this 2-1/2 day public conference, honoring the 40th anniversary of Ecotopia and the 50th anniversary of UCSC, we mean to reflect on life, art, literature, science and the future in “Ecotopia.”

Date: November, 6-8, 2015
