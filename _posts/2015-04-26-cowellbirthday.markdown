<div class="event-type-host">Party | Hosted by: Cowell, UE</div>
Cowell was the founding college of UCSC. We will celebrate turning 50 years old with a brunch. The party will include some speeches. Please note that the brunch was first held during alumni weekend 2011 and so this event will also mark 5 years of alumni gathering for bacon and eggs and bagels and lox on the Cowell Provost's Lawn.

Date: April 26, 2015
