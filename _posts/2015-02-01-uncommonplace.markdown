####Hosted by: Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery, Porter College
An Uncommon Place: Shaping the Santa Cruz Campus will present an ongoing investigation into the transformation of a spectacular natural site into the one of the most cherished university campuses in the world. 

Beginning with the assumption that UCSC’s extraordinary physical setting and its educational vision are inseparable, the exhibition will focus on place-making and architecture as a broadly interactive process. How did the ensemble of sites, structures, and environments that form the UCSC campus take shape? How has this special place been sustained and transformed through changing times and in relation to an evolving educational project? We hope that a deeper awareness of these issues and actions will add to UCSC’s growing legacy, inform future discussions, and contribute to a beautiful, vibrant campus well into the future.

Date: Spring 2015
