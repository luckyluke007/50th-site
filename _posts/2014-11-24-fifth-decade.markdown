2006: Long before San Francisco's Fillmore District attracted bands like the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, it was home in the 1940s and '50s to a booming jazz scene with clubs and virtuoso players.

In Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era, the acclaimed book he coauthored, UC Santa Cruz professor of art Lewis Watts unearthed the community’s glorious past.

2008: The Grateful Dead announced in April that the band will donate its archives to UC Santa Cruz. Band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart made the announcement at a press conference held in San Francisco's historic Fillmore Auditorium.

The Grateful Dead Archive will reside in Special Collections and a dedicated room — named Dead Central — will be part of the newly refurbished McHenry Library.
