The African American Theater Arts Troupe (AATAT) is a student-based organization that came together under the leadership and direction of Donald Williams in 1991. 

AATAT was formed as a vehicle to create unity, higher visibility, and understanding of the African American culture here at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The troupe is the only one of its kind in the UC System. For more information about the troupe and upcoming productions, please visit [www.cadrc.org](http://www.cadrc.org).
