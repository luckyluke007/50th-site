Alumni Weekend and reunion celebrations are more lively, fun and inspiring if your classmates come back to celebrate with you.

No matter the amount of time you are able to commit, we have an opportunity for you:

- **Write postcards to classmates**
 
  We need a group of proud Banana Slugs to help with our outreach efforts leading up to the weekend by personally inviting old friends and classmates to join you at Alumni Weekend. We provide the postcards and stamps; you just pick the names (we can give you a list to help trigger your memory!)
  - We will send you a postcard packet. 
  - You are free to reach out to as many or as few as people as you like. Volunteers often choose to contact 15-30 alumni. 

- **Personally reach out to your network via email**
 
  If picking up a pen and writing a postcard is not your style, why not send old friends and classmates personal emails inviting them to Alumni Weekend. Let us know who you would like to get in touch with and we'll help you connect. We even have some sample language we can share to help get you started.
  
- **Volunteer at Alumni Weekend**
 
  With so many fun events happening, we will need volunteers to help during Alumni Weekend. Please let us know if you are interested in volunteering at an event.
