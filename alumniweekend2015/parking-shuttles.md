Parking and transportation around campus can be a bit challenging. To make Alumni Weekend accessible and convenient to attend, we will provide complementary parking and shuttle service to support Alumni Weekend events.

### Parking Permits

In honor of Alumni Weekend, University Relations has paid for guest parking on Saturday, April 24 and Sunday, April 25, so no permits are required. Guests are welcome to park in any lot marked for A, B, C, or R permits. Please do not park in any spots marked with special designations such as Disabled, Medical, Carpool, “O”, or at parking meters. Regular enforcement will still be enforced for those types of spots, as well as red zones and 10 minute zones.

### East Remote Parking Shuttle

##### Time: 8am to 8pm

With Cowell College serving as a hub for major events (lunch, teach-ins, wine reception, etc.), parking will be very limited. Guests participating in these events are encouraged to park at East Remote and use complimentary shuttle service to get to and from Cowell. From 8am until 6pm, shuttles will run every 5 minutes from East Remote to Cowell College. Shuttle service will continue from the East Field (bonfire) to East Remote from 6pm until 8pm.

### Campus Loop Shuttle

##### Time: 9am to 6pm

To assist guests in moving around campus, shuttles will run campus loops every 10 minutes between 9am and 6pm. Beginning at the main entrance to campus, the bus will run in a counter clockwise loop with stops at the bus stops adjacent to East Remote, East Field, Baytree Plaza, Cowell/Stevenson, Crown/Merrill, Colleges Nine & Ten, Science Hill, Kresge, Porter/Performing Arts, College Eight, Oakes, Arboretum, and concluding the loop at campus Main Entrance.
