Parking and transportation around campus can be a bit challenging. To make Alumni Weekend accessible and convenient to attend, we will provide complementary parking and shuttle service to support Alumni Weekend events.

Parking is free of charge (no permit required) in the majority of lots on the UCSC campus starting at 5 p.m. on Friday until 8 a.m. on Monday.  The exceptions to this are:

- Performing Arts Parking Lot (Lot 126)

- Social Science Lots at Colleges Nine and Ten (Lots 164, 165, 166)

Permits are required from 7 a.m. - 8:30 p.m., seven days a week.

Complimentary permits will be issued for these lots on Saturday, April 27. Staff will be onsite in the Performing Arts Lot (8 a.m. - 5 p.m.) and the Social Sciences Lots (5 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.) to distribute permits.

On Saturday, April 27, a special shuttle service will loop around campus from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
