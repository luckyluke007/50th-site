## Founders Medal: Alice Waters
Chef, restaurateur, activist, and author Alice Waters, proprietor of legendary Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, has been cited as one of the most influential figures in food in the past 50 years, and has been called the mother of American food.

One of the most visible supporters of the organic food movement, she is a pioneer of a culinary philosophy that maintains that cooking should be based on the finest and freshest seasonal ingredients that are produced sustainably and locally.
