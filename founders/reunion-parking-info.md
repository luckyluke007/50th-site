## Friday, September 25
**At the Santa Cruz Dream Inn, 175 W Cliff Dr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060**

There are two options to park at the Dream Inn for the Friday event. You can use the valet service, or self park in the lot across the street.

To use the valet service, pull up directly in front of the hotel & the valets will park your car. You can then walk down the garden path way to the food & beverage building where the banquet rooms are located.

Alternatively, you can park in the large parking lot across the street.  You will need to pull a ticket to get through the parking gate. Please hold on to the parking ticket and bring that with you to the banquet space or the front desk. The Banquet server or the front desk can validate this ticket for you.  You will use this same ticket when you leave to open the exit gate. If you park in the lot across the street, please use the crosswalk to get to the hotel then walk down the garden path way to the food & beverage building where the banquet rooms are located.

## Saturday, September 26 - Sunday, September 9/27

Complimentary parking will be available for Pioneer Reunion guests in the East Remote Parking Lot on Saturday, September 26 and Sunday, September 27. As the East Remote Parking Lot is a 10-15 minute walk that includes a large hill, we will have shuttles running from the kiosk that is in the rear of the parking lot, up to the event locations on both days. 

To get to East Remote Parking Lot, enter the Main Entrance to campus and proceed on Coolidge Drive. Continue on Coolidge Drive until you reach the second stoplight, and take a left onto Hagar Drive. Continue on Hagar Drive for approximately two minutes until you reach East Remote Parking Lot on your right hand side. If you have reached the East Field House and Cowell College on your right hand side you have gone too far.

There will be signs at the base of campus directing guests up the hill to East Remote Parking Lot. There will also be signs directing guests to the East Field House for Saturday’s Events, as well as signs directing guests to the Cowell Provost House for Sunday’s Events. 

Shuttles will be running on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and again from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday’s event runs from 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. Shuttles on Saturday will pick up from East Remote Parking Lot and will bring guests up the hill to the East Field House.

Shuttles will be provided Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and will be running throughout the entire day. Sunday’s events run from 10:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. Shuttles on Sunday will pick up from East Remote Parking Lot and will bring guests up the hill to the Cowell Provost House.

The shuttles take approximately five minutes to reach your destination. There will be two shuttles running during scheduled times to ensure our guests get to the events on time. The wait time for a shuttle should not exceed ten minutes.
