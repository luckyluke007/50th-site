As part of the 2015 Founders Celebration we are planning reunion gatherings and activities stretching from Friday, September 25, through Sunday, September 27, with special reunion program on Saturday from 9:30 am until 3:30 pm.  Save these dates and stay tuned for more information.

## Schedule of Events:

- **Friday, September 25: Pioneer Welcome Reception, 6-9 p.m., Santa Cruz Dream Inn** <br />
We will welcome back the Pioneer Class in style with appetizers and a no-host bar. This will be a time to mix and mingle with other students who were on campus in 1965.

- **Saturday, September 26: Pioneer Reunion, 9 a.m.-3:30 p.m., East Field House** <br />
Saturday will feature a full day of events from lectures to mingling to lunches, all under the one roof there was in 1965—in other words, the pioneers will once again be taking over the East Field House! The continental breakfast will be served at 9 a.m., and the lunch will start at noon.

- **Sunday, September 27: Pioneer Brunch, 10 a.m.-noon, Cowell Provost House** <br />
A final event for the weekend, a time to relax on the Cowell Provost House lawn with a view of the bay over brunch.

- **Sunday, September 27: Pioneer Faculty Panel, 1-2 p.m., Location TBA** <br />
A gathering at Cowell College with a few founding faculty members to speak about their experiences and memories of the early UC Santa Cruz days with the pioneer class students.

- On Saturday evening, a local Pioneer Class alumni will be hosting a casual get-together for the Pioneer Class from 6 p.m. to Midnight at his home.  This event is open to all pioneers, for those going to the Fiat Fifty event, feel free to join us after dinner.  This event will be BYO drinks and food, though some hors d’oeuvres will be served.  To find out more information about how to get there and how to register for this event, please email Amanda at [ammhill@ucsc.edu](mailto:ammhill@ucsc.edu).
- **Looking for a place to stay?**<br />
The alumni office and the Pioneer Reunion Committee want to make sure that everyone has a place to stay during the event. If you are interested in being a host, or are interested in housing for that weekend, please email Amanda Hill at ammhill@ucsc.edu. Once we get a sense of the housing that is available and the number of attendees who would like housing, we will follow up with you.
