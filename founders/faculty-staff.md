For our 50th anniversary we will honor the people that helped to open our doors fifty years ago. The Fiat Lux award will be given to the entire UC Santa Cruz pioneer staff and faculty. If you were part of this amazing group we are delighted to host you at this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.

We look forward to celebrating with you.
