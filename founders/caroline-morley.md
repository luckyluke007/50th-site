Ph.D. candidate UC Santa Cruz

<div class="caption-small">{% img /css/assets/images/founders/caroline-morley.jpg "Steven Hawley" "Steven Hawley" %}</div> Caroline is a 5th year graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, studying the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. During her PhD she has applied atmosphere models to a variety of objects from super Earths to brown dwarfs.  She has led papers showing the effect that salt and sulfide clouds will have on T dwarf spectra and colors and exploring the flat transmission spectrum of the “super-Earth” GJ 1214b. She has studied the coldest brown dwarfs—the new spectral class Y dwarfs—many of which will be cold enough for water clouds to condense in their upper atmospheres.
