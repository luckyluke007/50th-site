***Increased Visibility:*** Sponsors of this historic event will automatically benefit from media promotion during the event's marketing campaign, providing exposure and visibility throughout the community.

***Enhanced Brand:***  Increased visibility leads to brand recognition which in turn makes closing sales all the more effortless. 

***Enhanced Image:***  Supporting such a milestone event signals a commitment and concern for the community. Many consumers make purchasing decisions based upon this quality. Residents often show favor to businesses who support local causes and in many cases, will go out of their way to support companies that support their community.

***Targeted Marketing:***  Highlighting your business with a captive and relevant audience will help you stand out in the crowd and reach your target prospects. Data on past attendees: high net worth individuals, over half of whom are 50-60 years old and own their own home; two thirds of attendees are from Santa Cruz County with most of the remainder coming from Bay Area communities; approximately one third are alumni.

***Networking Opportunities:***  Your sponsorship will provide the opportunity to network with VIPs, regional elected officials, other like-minded businesses, and the "Who's Who" of Santa Cruz offering unique opportunities for engagement and for business development.

***Enhanced Rapport with Customers, Prospects, Employees:***  Sponsoring this event is the perfect way to thank customers for their business, engage new prospects, and recognize outstanding employees for their service.
