Beginning on **January 1, 2015** and ending **December 31, 2015**, every 50th transcript ordered by either a current student or alum of UC Santa Cruz will be free! The cost of the actual transcript ($15 without narrative evaluations/$20 with narrative evaluations) will automatically be deducted from the order fee during the ordering process with our transcript order processing vendor, Credentials Solutions. Additional fees, including the per-transcript $2.30 processing fee; rush order fees; express mailing fees; notarization fees, Sign & Seal fees; etc. will not be covered by this program, and will be included in the final amount owed during the ordering process.

To order transcripts, [please visit and follow the instructions](http://registrar.ucsc.edu/records/transcripts/ordering.html).
Any questions regarding this program can be directed to the Office of the Registrar at 831-459-4412.
