1989: To accommodate a campus growing in students and programs, UC Santa Cruz was the scene of a large number of building projects this year.

Sinsheimer Labs was being finalized for an expected dedication in October, as was the campus's new Student Center. Residence halls for the new College Eight were still under construction, and excavation had begun for a new Science Library. And on the construction horizon was the Earth and Marine Sciences Building and the Music Center.

In this photo, there's still much work needed to be done on UCSC's newest college, College Eight.

1989: The Loma Prieta Earthquake, with an epicenter near Santa Cruz, was felt throughout Northern California. In the downtown area of Santa Cruz, the quake was especially tragic, costing 3 people their lives. On campus, just a few miles away, the damage was widespread but much less severe.

In this photo, the library stacks at McHenry have toppled, leaving a massive cleanup effort.

1994: UC Santa Cruz anthropologist Adrienne Zihlman, one of the world's preeminent primatologists, receives permission to dissect the 380-pound body of Bwana, the beloved San Francisco Zoo gorilla that had died months earlier.

At that time, little was known about the anatomy of gorillas, and the information Zihlman would glean enabled her to do male-female and primate comparisons that made up the core of her research.
