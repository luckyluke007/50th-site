The dates of the conference are Friday March 13th-Saturday March 14th.\r\rOur overarching theme this year is \u201cNo Prospect of an End\u201d: Living with an Ever Changing Climate. The quote from James Hutton\u2019s Theory of the Earth is not meant to be depressing. Rather, we want to remind (or enlighten) audience members that if we do not dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we may trigger a rapid shift in climate that might not slow for a millennium, and that those new hot conditions might last many tens of millennia. From a societal perspective, climate change would seem never ending, and predicting environmental conditions in that future \u201chot house\u201d world will be very difficult.\r\rThe Friday night lecture to kick off the event will feature eminent geologist Richard Alley (Penn State).  Alley is renown for his work on glaciers, abrupt climate change, and sea level.\r\rFollowing Friday's lecture, on Saturday will be a day-long 2-part panel discussion, the core of the conference. Panelists include climate scientists, civil servants, economists, and educators from across the country.\r\rThe morning Panel will focus on Coastal Resilience: Weathering the Coming Storm \r\rThe afternoon panel's focus is Wicked Solutions: Unavoidable Tradeoffs between Food, Water, Energy, and Biodiversity.  \r\rWe anticipate many lively discussions as we have the panelist interact with the audience (We expect a sell-out crowd)\r"}},{"event":{"title":"Science Sunday: Making Mummies Talk","teaser":"Science Sunday: Making Mummies TalkUsing fossils to understand how seals will respond to environmental changePaul Koch, Ph.D.Dean, Physical and Biological SciencesProfessor, Earth and Planetary SciencesUC Santa Cruz","location":"Seymour Marine Discovery Center","location_details":"","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2963","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1426449600","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/Screen-shot-2015-02-26-at-11.18.16-AM.png?itok=o1bAu827","alt":""},"description":"**Science Sunday: Making Mummies Talk**\r*Using fossils to understand how seals will respond to environmental change*\rPaul Koch, Ph.D.\rDean, Physical and Biological Sciences\rProfessor, Earth and Planetary Sciences\rUC Santa Cruz\r\rUnderstanding how animals responded to environmental shifts in the past may offer important clues as to how they will deal with the challenges of the coming centuries. Mummies are an especially rich source of information. Beyond just letting us know who lived where in the past, they provide information on population size, body condition, reproductive traits, and feeding preferences as revealed by studies of anatomy,ancient DNA, and forensic chemistry.\r\rThe frigid, dry climates of Antarctica are especially conducive to natural mummification of animals. Large numbers of seals have wandered into the Dry Valleys of Antarctica where they perished and now dot the landscape as mummies that can be sampled for studies of past ecology.\r\rKoch will discuss his work on mummies to understand the ecology of the seals that lived in the Ross Sea of Antarctica over the past 8,000 years, and how insights gained from study of mummies might be important for conservation of the species in the future.\r\rLecture is free with admission.

Neither a natural history, an institutional history, nor a purely architectural history, their project focuses on place making, and on architecture as a broadly interactive process. \r\rHow did the ensemble of sites, structures, and environments that is the UC Santa Cruz campus take shape? How has this special place been sustained and transformed through changing times and in relation to an evolving educational project? Where has it fallen short? What has been overlooked? The group\u2019s approach has been founded on the assumption that UCSC\u2019s extraordinary physical setting and the university\u2019s educational vision are inseparable. \r\rThe campus, praised by all for its beauty, remains in a continuing process of adaptation, negotiating inherent tensions and contradictions in changing historical moments. A tradition as well as an essential resource, it needs to be critically understood, and celebrated.\r\r[An Uncommon Place: Shaping the UC Santa Cruz Campus](http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/exhibitions/upcoming) is the first result of their efforts. Combining seldom seen architectural drawings and photographs with remarks from participants and observers of campus development, the exhibition traces decisive moments in the early creation of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s built environment and the visions that shaped the campus. \r\rThe exhibition evokes paths taken and not taken in the first decades of campus development: decisions, constraints, hopes, realities. It celebrates the achievement of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s founding planners who married an extraordinary physical site with an innovative educational project and it analyzes the tensions and contradictions the founders built into the campus. Through its many subsequent transformations, the university that took shape on rugged forested terrain atop a high hill, remains an uncommon place.\r\rGallery hours are: \rTuesday \u2013 Saturday, 12:00\u20135:00 p.m. & \rWednesday 12:00-8:00 p.m."}},{"event":{"title":"Rhythms of Place: Photographic Explorations of the UCSC Campus","teaser":"The Santa Cruz campus is often said to be \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201cspectacular\u201d\u2014words that strain to evoke a sense of place for which we lack adequate language.","location":"","location_details":"Porter College Faculty Gallery","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3001","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1428519600","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/Rhythms%20of%20place-Website%20image.jpeg?itok=31tePMnl","alt":""},"description":"The Santa Cruz campus is often said to be \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201cspectacular\u201d\u2014words that strain to evoke a sense of place for which we lack adequate language.

The environmental movement has long been dominated by a Western philosophy that sees humans as separate from and detrimental to nature. While great strides have been made in the past few decades, most scientists will agree that conservation efforts are simply not keeping up with the vast scale of planetary change. Despite our best efforts, the conservation movement is failing.   \r \r**Dr. M. Sanjayan**, Executive Vice President and Senior Scientist for Conservation International and UCSC grad (Graduate Divison 97), has just returned from a global quest to explore what it means to save nature in a world where wildness no longer exists. Looking beyond the expected devastation of human activity on the natural world, Sanjayan found places\u2014most at the frontiers of where people and wildlife meet\u2014where people can help nature thrive. Even more crucially, this \"new wild\" relationship is benefiting human well-being in ways we never before imagined.\r\rSanjayan\u2019s talk will draw on his 2015 PBS television series [EARTH: A New Wild](http://www.pbs.org/earth-a-new-wild/home/) to reveal how, through human ingenuity, technology and sometimes ecological tragedy, people are becoming a positive part of the ecological systems we depend on for our well-being. The result is a new framework that reinvents environmentalism by making saving nature about saving ourselves. \r\rThis presentation is part of the *True Originals Notable Alumni Speakers Series*.\r\r**Award Presentation**\rDr. Sanjayan is the recipient of the 2015-2016 Alumni Association [Alumni Achievement Award](http://alumni.ucsc.edu/association/awards-programs/alumni-achievement-award.html); the highest honor bestowed on a graduate of UC Santa Cruz.

The eruptions are a kind of planetary recreation, and generating magma re-creates the Earth. My talk will explore both aspects, and be illustrated. Eruptions, and the volcanoes that they create, differ because the magmas that erupt are highly variable in composition because what melts (the source rock) is so variable. I will summarize eruptions, magmas, and sources from the three main volcanic regimes on Earth: mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates are born; ocean islands where they are middle- aged; and subduction zones where they die. I will emphasize subduction zones (e.g., the Circum-Pacific Ring of Fire) because that is where I have spent most of my career, both on land and below the sea. Those magmas are unique to Earth, are the most explosive, create the most valuable metal deposits, and produce the continents on which we live. I will discuss their origin, their role in Earth evolution, and how they are studied in the field and laboratory."}},{"event":{"title":"The Accelerating Universe: Einstein's Blunder Undone","teaser":"Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics talks about exploding stars and the accelerating universe.","location":"","location_details":"Rio Theatre1205 Soquel Avenue Santa Cruz, CA 95062","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2996","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1431568800","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/mandellecture.png?itok=NTaaq3LW","alt":""},"description":"Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics talks about exploding stars and the accelerating universe.\r\rThe discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is one of the most surprising results of 20th century astrophysics.  Around 1916, Albert Einstein famously introduced a \"cosmological constant\" to make a static universe.  In the 1930s, the work of Edwin Hubble and others showed that we live in an expanding universe and Einstein shunned his own creation.  But in the 1990s, astronomers began to develop sharp tools for accurately measuring the history of comic expansion over the past 5 billion years.  The observations of thermonuclear supernovae showed that the Universe is not just expanding, but that the expansion is speeding up.  We attribute this astonishing fact to the presence of \"dark energy\" which may be a modern form of the cosmological constant.  Today, a firm web of evidence makes the dark energy a leading mystery of modern physics."}},{"event":{"title":"The Miriam Ellis International Playhouse","teaser":"15 YEARS OLD AND COUNTING!...","location":"Stevenson Event Center","location_details":"","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3084","event_instances":"4","event_date":"1431658800","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/IP%20image_0.jpg?itok=XbEGdc18","alt":""},"description":"15 YEARS OLD AND COUNTING!...\r\rThe Department of Languages and Applied Linguistics, Cowell College, and Stevenson College, will present The Miriam Ellis International Playhouse (MEIP), an annual multilingual program of fully-staged short theater pieces, for its 15th season.

Years of research into this question tell us clearly that yes, it can. Many studies, some of which I conducted at UCSC, show that the kind of art we are attracted to depends on our personality, while others show that our personality guides the kind of art that we will produce. Art clearly serves our personal needs. \r\rBut does psychology explain great art? Only up to a point.  In some artists\u2019 lives we can find early traumas, while in others we can find comments on their daily life in their art. Each finding, and many others like it, connects the art to the artist\u2019s life. But not all art, of any artist, is connected to their life. Can psychology explain the art that remains independent? And can it explain whether the art is great, or at least good, or altogether mediocre? \r\rThese are more complicated questions. The life and work of the great artist C\u00e9zanne is an excellent example.  His landscapes, for example, show how closely his art depended on the appearance of things. (I will show my photographs of the sites that he painted.) Yet they are also great works of art, with careful attention to composition and color harmony, and especially to the brushstrokes by which the painting surface is unified. We can account for his dependence on the model \u2013 but not for his creative independence from it. In my talk, I will deal with this complexity, and conclude with my view of the role of psychology in understanding art.\r\r\r"}},{"event":{"title":"The Sixth Annual Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading","teaser":"For UCSC's 50th Anniversary, California Poet Laureate, Al Young, poet, novelist, screenwriter, and former UCSC lecturer in Creative Writing, will be our honored guest reader.","location":"","location_details":"","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2768","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1447380000","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/alyoung_0.jpg?itok=ClxJRjJi","alt":""},"description":"For UCSC's 50th Anniversary, California Poet Laureate, Al Young, poet, novelist, screenwriter, and former UCSC lecturer in Creative Writing, will be our honored guest reader.\r\rThe Annual Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading honors poet Morton Marcus (1936-2009), continues Mort's tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, and highlights his poetry archive housed in UCSC's Special Collections and Archives."}}]}
