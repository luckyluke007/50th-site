Neither a natural history, an institutional history, nor a purely architectural history, their project focuses on place making, and on architecture as a broadly interactive process. \r\rHow did the ensemble of sites, structures, and environments that is the UC Santa Cruz campus take shape? How has this special place been sustained and transformed through changing times and in relation to an evolving educational project? Where has it fallen short? What has been overlooked? The group\u2019s approach has been founded on the assumption that UCSC\u2019s extraordinary physical setting and the university\u2019s educational vision are inseparable. \r\rThe campus, praised by all for its beauty, remains in a continuing process of adaptation, negotiating inherent tensions and contradictions in changing historical moments. A tradition as well as an essential resource, it needs to be critically understood, and celebrated.\r\r[An Uncommon Place: Shaping the UC Santa Cruz Campus](http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/exhibitions/upcoming) is the first result of their efforts. Combining seldom seen architectural drawings and photographs with remarks from participants and observers of campus development, the exhibition traces decisive moments in the early creation of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s built environment and the visions that shaped the campus. \r\rThe exhibition evokes paths taken and not taken in the first decades of campus development: decisions, constraints, hopes, realities. It celebrates the achievement of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s founding planners who married an extraordinary physical site with an innovative educational project and it analyzes the tensions and contradictions the founders built into the campus. Through its many subsequent transformations, the university that took shape on rugged forested terrain atop a high hill, remains an uncommon place.\r\rGallery hours are: \rTuesday \u2013 Saturday, 12:00\u20135:00 p.m. & \rWednesday 12:00-8:00 p.m."}},{"event":{"title":"The Feminist Architecture of Gloria Anzaldua: New Translations, Crossings and Pedagogies in Anzalduan Thought","teaser":"A Conference on the Work of Gloria Evangelina Anzaldua","location":"Humanities 1 Building","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2738","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1428649200","thumbnail":"","description":"A Conference on the Work of Gloria Evangelina Anzaldua\r\rGloria Evangelina Anzald\u00faa \u2014 poet, philosopher, and critical scholar \u2014 founded, wrote, and encouraged a transformative body of writing and scholarship, with generative influences on critical race, feminist, queer, and decolonizing ways of knowing.

The environmental movement has long been dominated by a Western philosophy that sees humans as separate from and detrimental to nature. While great strides have been made in the past few decades, most scientists will agree that conservation efforts are simply not keeping up with the vast scale of planetary change. Despite our best efforts, the conservation movement is failing.   \r \rDr. M. Sanjayan, Executive Vice President and Senior Scientist for Conservation International and UCSC grad (Graduate Divison 97), has just returned from a global quest to explore what it means to save nature in a world where wildness no longer exists. Looking beyond the expected devastation of human activity on the natural world, Sanjayan found places\u2014most at the frontiers of where people and wildlife meet\u2014where people can help nature thrive. Even more crucially, this \"new wild\" relationship is benefiting human well-being in ways we never before imagined.\r\rSanjayan\u2019s talk will draw on his 2015 PBS television series *EARTH: A New Wild* to reveal how, through human ingenuity, technology and sometimes ecological tragedy, people are becoming a positive part of the ecological systems we depend on for our well-being. The result is a new framework that reinvents environmentalism by making saving nature about saving ourselves. \r\rThis presentation is part of the *True Originals Notable Alumni Speakers Series*."}},{"event":{"title":"Banana Slug Kid Zone","teaser":"A family-friendly event where alums can visit different craft booths with their little Banana Slugs.","location":"","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2816","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1429981200","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/Banana%20Slug%20Kid%20Zone.jpg?itok=XKP7Wv7h","alt":""},"description":"A family-friendly event where alums can visit different craft booths with their little Banana Slugs. \r\rAlums and their little slugs can visit different craft booths, game stations and more.
