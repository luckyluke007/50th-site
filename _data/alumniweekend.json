The walk will include stops chosen by both alumni and current students that are important to their experiences and memories of UC Santa Cruz.\r\rWhether at the site where the student Astronomy Club gathers to stargaze on clear nights or at the art studio that inspired the curatorial career of an alumna, the stops along the walk will provide a rare and personal glimpse of a campus that has had an immeasurable impact on its community. At each of the six stops along the walk, alumni or present students will tell the stories that show how the university shaped them.\r\rAbout the Artists:\rPublic Doors and Windows is a collaborative artist team made up of Harrell Fletcher, Molly Sherman, and Nolan Calisch. They are based in Portland, Oregon. Together they create participatory and site-specific projects that engage with and include local people and the broad public. The walk is part of a larger project undertaken by the artists to create a 'collective museum' out of the UC Santa Cruz campus, using the techniques of display ad meaning making usually associated with museums to think about the university and what is happening within it.\r\rThe artists are documenting the collections already held on campus while also getting different people\u2013 staff, faculty, students, and alumni\u2013 to pick sites that are meaningful in some way, either in regards to their research, to the history of UCSC, or for more personal reasons. Those sites and collections are photographed, marked with a plaque, and included in the 'museum tour' of the campus that will launch in February 2016. The information about each site will be archived online, in a 'museum catalogue,' as well as in exhibition walls spread around campus. \r\rFor more information on the project and the artists:\r\rhttp://ias.ucsc.edu/projects/collective-museum"}},{"event":{"title":"Porter College / College 5 Reception","teaser":"Provosts Emeriti Kathy Foley and David Evan Jones seek the pleasure of your company at the Porter College Koi Pond for refreshments and conversation among friends.","location":"Porter College","location_details":"Poter College Koi Pond","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2805","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1429911000","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/Porter%20College-College%205%20Reception.jpg?itok=kwowdWN0","alt":""},"description":"Provosts Emeriti Kathy Foley and David Evan Jones seek the pleasure of your company at the Porter College Koi Pond for refreshments and conversation among friends. \r\rIn Japanese culture, koi symbolize love, friendship and affection.

The environmental movement has long been dominated by a Western philosophy that sees humans as separate from and detrimental to nature. While great strides have been made in the past few decades, most scientists will agree that conservation efforts are simply not keeping up with the vast scale of planetary change. Despite our best efforts, the conservation movement is failing.   \r \r**Dr. M. Sanjayan**, Executive Vice President and Senior Scientist for Conservation International and UCSC grad (Graduate Divison 97), has just returned from a global quest to explore what it means to save nature in a world where wildness no longer exists. Looking beyond the expected devastation of human activity on the natural world, Sanjayan found places\u2014most at the frontiers of where people and wildlife meet\u2014where people can help nature thrive. Even more crucially, this \"new wild\" relationship is benefiting human well-being in ways we never before imagined.\r\rSanjayan\u2019s talk will draw on his 2015 PBS television series [EARTH: A New Wild](http://www.pbs.org/earth-a-new-wild/home/) to reveal how, through human ingenuity, technology and sometimes ecological tragedy, people are becoming a positive part of the ecological systems we depend on for our well-being. The result is a new framework that reinvents environmentalism by making saving nature about saving ourselves. \r\rThis presentation is part of the *True Originals Notable Alumni Speakers Series*.\r\r**Award Presentation**\rDr. Sanjayan is the recipient of the 2015-2016 Alumni Association [Alumni Achievement Award](http://alumni.ucsc.edu/association/awards-programs/alumni-achievement-award.html); the highest honor bestowed on a graduate of UC Santa Cruz.

How has this special place been sustained and transformed over 50 years, in relation to an evolving educational project? Where has it fallen short? What has been overlooked in our conversations about it? The campus, praised by all for its beauty, remains in a continuing process of adaptation, negotiating inherent tensions and contradictions in changing historical moments. A tradition as well as an essential resource, it needs to be critically understood, and celebrated. This walk will view the campus through a number of lenses: historical, poetic, critical, and practical.
