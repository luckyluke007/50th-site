The environmental movement has long been dominated by a Western philosophy that sees humans as separate from and detrimental to nature. While great strides have been made in the past few decades, most scientists will agree that conservation efforts are simply not keeping up with the vast scale of planetary change. Despite our best efforts, the conservation movement is failing.   \r \r**Dr. M. Sanjayan**, Executive Vice President and Senior Scientist for Conservation International and UCSC grad (Graduate Divison 97), has just returned from a global quest to explore what it means to save nature in a world where wildness no longer exists. Looking beyond the expected devastation of human activity on the natural world, Sanjayan found places\u2014most at the frontiers of where people and wildlife meet\u2014where people can help nature thrive. Even more crucially, this \"new wild\" relationship is benefiting human well-being in ways we never before imagined.\r\rSanjayan\u2019s talk will draw on his 2015 PBS television series [EARTH: A New Wild](http://www.pbs.org/earth-a-new-wild/home/) to reveal how, through human ingenuity, technology and sometimes ecological tragedy, people are becoming a positive part of the ecological systems we depend on for our well-being.
