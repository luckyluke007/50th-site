The environmental movement has long been dominated by a Western philosophy that sees humans as separate from and detrimental to nature. While great strides have been made in the past few decades, most scientists will agree that conservation efforts are simply not keeping up with the vast scale of planetary change. Despite our best efforts, the conservation movement is failing.   \r \r**Dr. M. Sanjayan**, Executive Vice President and Senior Scientist for Conservation International and UCSC grad (Graduate Divison 97), has just returned from a global quest to explore what it means to save nature in a world where wildness no longer exists. Looking beyond the expected devastation of human activity on the natural world, Sanjayan found places\u2014most at the frontiers of where people and wildlife meet\u2014where people can help nature thrive. Even more crucially, this \"new wild\" relationship is benefiting human well-being in ways we never before imagined.\r\rSanjayan\u2019s talk will draw on his 2015 PBS television series [EARTH: A New Wild](http://www.pbs.org/earth-a-new-wild/home/) to reveal how, through human ingenuity, technology and sometimes ecological tragedy, people are becoming a positive part of the ecological systems we depend on for our well-being. The result is a new framework that reinvents environmentalism by making saving nature about saving ourselves. \r\rThis presentation is part of the *True Originals Notable Alumni Speakers Series*.\r\rFor more information contact the [Special Events Office](mailto:specialevents@ucsc.edu), or call 831-459-5003."}},{"event":{"title":"Econ Alumni Reception","teaser":"Alumni, faculty, staff, and students are cordially invited to the Economics Department reunion in celebration of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s 50th Anniversary.","location":"Engineering 2","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2695","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1429981200","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/Econ%20Alumni%20Reception.jpg?itok=0MScAfmS","alt":""},"description":"Alumni, faculty, staff, and students are cordially invited to the Economics Department reunion in celebration of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s 50th Anniversary.\r\rFollowing a brief introduction and short presentation, a continental breakfast will be served in the courtyard where attendees may reconnect over their shared memories of their time on campus.\r\rFor more information contact Economics Department Assistant [Leigh Faulk](mailto:lsfaulk@ucsc.edu).\r"}},{"event":{"title":"The Creation of Beauty in the Company of Friends","teaser":"Since 2011, Cowell has started Alumni Weekend with a symposium.","location":"","link":"https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2694","event_instances":"1","event_date":"1429981200","thumbnail":{"src":"https://events.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale-380/public/events/The%20Creation%20of%20Beauty%20in%20the%20company%20of%20friends.jpg?itok=l2hXsWh8","alt":""},"description":"Since 2011, Cowell has started Alumni Weekend with a symposium. 2015 will mark the 5th anniversary of that tradition and the 50th year of Cowell College with a panel of three Pioneer artists, **Eric Thiermann**, **Holly Downing** and **Richard Shaffer**, who have lived their lives in art.\r\rAlumni and early faculty will gather in the Page Smith Library with the panelists and moderator **Bonita Banducci**, to discuss how their experiences at Cowell drew them toward art and shaped some of their approaches to art.\r\rOpen to all alumni and especially Cowell alumni.
